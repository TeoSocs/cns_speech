					General features of a remote file storage

				number = 3
data-notes="First of all, why would someone want to use a cloud storage system?
Buying some space on some cloud means that you have no longer to worry about maintain physically some machines, some servers to store your data. In a full-cloud scenario, you don't have to worry about buying new servers, provide a continous supply of electricity, repair faults, make reundant backup copies of your data (just joking, you should still backup it. Maybe a little less, but ONLY A LITTLE).
This obviously come to a price: Cloud storage are black-boxes for you, you don't know what's going on under the hood because you have to trust your cloud service provider.">
					### Remote file storage
					- More flexible infrastructure
					- Less cost for mid and small business
					- Less know how required
					- ...But...

					> They are fault-prone black boxes operated by a party other than the data owner

data-notes="There are a few fundamental requirements on which I would like you to focus in this presentation. Left ones are lower-level requirements, think them as the 'TCP/IP' of the storage systems. 
Data should be available, that means I should be able to read and write and use the system whenever I want.
Data should be fresh: not outdated or stale data.
Data should be consistent across the entire distributed system. There should be only one 'real' version of the data, even if replicated in several nodes of the cloud is unacceptable to have different conflicting files in each machine.
On the right instead we have higher level requirements, application level we could name them.
Data confidentiality regards who can read my data: if you are not authorized then you should not be able to read them.
No one shoud be able to tamper my data, so integrity is the second requirement.
In order to be sure that the user that wants to read or modify a file is who it claims to be, we need some authentication system.">

				<!-- 
					First Example: SiRiUS
				-->
				<section data-markdown
				number = 5
data-notes="As first example, I'll introduce SiRiUS. The aim of this project is to deliver a system easy for users to install and use. It should be installed over an existent system of cloud storage, in order to provide security and privacy features. As a consequence, referring to the past slide, it is focused on higher-level requirements.">
					### SiRiUS
					Securing Remote Untrusted Storage
					> "Easy for end-users to install and use."

					> "Can be **layered** on top of any network file system."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 6
data-notes="SiRiUS relies on metadata, hidden from the user, to achieve his goal. Also, it heavily uses public and private keys for encription and authentication.
Each file is encrypted with a symmetric key (we call it 'file key'). This key is then encrypted using the public key of each user, and added to the metadata file. In that way, when an authorized user wants to read the file, it can retrieve the file key from the metadata and use it.
File signature public key is used to check the integrity of the file, last modified timestamp is checked is used to enforce freshness check over the file system, and filename is used to link each file with his metadata file.
Metadata file is then signed using the owner's signature: that means only the file owner can modify it.">

				<section data-markdown
				number = 7
data-notes="This data structure successfully ensure the three security requirements desired, usign the properties of asymmetric keys. Only the authorized users can decrypt the file and read it (or modify it), file signature prevents undetected tampering of the file content, and I am sure that a user is who it claims to be because he is in possession of his specific private key.">

data-notes="Takling the higher level, this system falls a bit short on lower level requirements: freshness is only guaranteed for the metadata, there is no timestamp on the file content. Availability too is not addressed in any way, just delegated to the system that host SiRiUS.">
					### Other requirements
					- Freshness
						- Guaranteed for metadata
					- ~~Availability~~
						- _Delegated to lower layers_
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 9
data-notes="This directly exposes some issues: Denial-Of-Service attacks is possible, targeting the underlying system.
A seizing attack is also possible: it is an attack where a malicious user change the entire content of the file system (metadata included) to add his key everywhere. It is quite impossible to perform this kind of attack undetected, but still..!
We have rollback issues: a malicious user could simply continously replace a file with an older version of it. There are some workaround to prevent this, but the 'vanilla protocol' is vulnerable.
The final, enormous issue is the performance issue.">
					### Problems
					- Availability (DoS)
					- Seizing
					- Rollback
					- **Performance**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 10
data-notes="These are the slowdown factors on read and write using SiRiUS. They are huge, and this mainly depends on Asymmetric key system. 63% of the read time is spent on AES decrypt, 40% of the write time on signature generation, these are very significative numbers!">

					Second Example: CRUST
				-->
				<section data-markdown
				number = 11
data-notes="This take us to our second example: CRUST. Learning from SiRiUS, it substantially presents the same structure, adapted in order to work without asymmetric keys.">
					### CRUST
					Cryptographic Remote Untrusted Storage

					without Public Keys
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 12
data-notes="This obviously require some workarounds:
Using symmetric keys I have to use a specific key for every file, for every user. Then, these key should be distributed and shared.
In CRUST, a Trusted Agent is needed during initialization. The agent shares a secret key with each user (master key), and maintains a public database of 'seeds' that can be used together with the master user key to derive the file-specific user key.
The metadata file structure is substantially the same of SiRiUS, so I won't dive deeper into that.">
					### Design
					- Needs a Trusted Agent
						- Shares a secret key with each user
						- Public database of _"key seeds"_
					- Meta-data structure of SiRiUS
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 13
data-notes="Using symmetric encryption dramatically improve performance: here we can compare CRUST and SiRiUS read and write speed.
The cost however is significative: a trusted agent is NOT a minor introduction in this kind of system, and a key distribution is a critical, dangerous process.
In addiction, even CRUST, like SiRiUS, target 'application level' requirements, and so it cannot solve lower level flaws.">
					<textarea data-template>
						### Better performance
						| | CRUST | SiRiUS |
						|---|---|---|
						|Read|1.03x|2.3x|
						|Write|1.28x|6.3x|

					<!-- 
						Final Example: Depot
					-->
					<section data-markdown
					number = 14
data-notes="An entirely different approach is the one behind Depot, the third example and object of the main paper that we all have already read.
Depot says 'ok, first of all the state of the art around is a mess. We should give a sort of formalization of the requirement needed by a secure cloud infrastructure'. They did it and realize that there is a 'main' requirement that needs to be achieved, and in order to grasp it they should 'go deeper' (have you seen inception?).">
						### Depot
						Cloud storage with minimal trust
					</section>
					<section data-markdown
					number = 15
data-notes="So, Depot focus on the lower level requirements. It eliminates trust for safety and minimizes trust for liveness and availability.">
						### Properties
						- Eliminates trust for safety
						- Minimizes trust for liveness and availability
					</section>
					<section data-markdown
					number = 16
data-notes="It relies on three simple key ideas:
First, the system should be a full-distributed system. There shouldn't be any single point of failure, even clients should be able to provide reads to other clients if ther have fresh data about it.
Second, it tracks the entire history of a file. Imagine that it works as a big git repository. Every step is recorded, and misbehavior is just concurrency. Someone else is modifying my 'path' and I'm not aware of it.
Under this assumption, the 'master requirement' is to enforce Fork-Join-Causal consistency. That is, we should preserve dependencies between different nodes of these paths.
This provides a solid base, and the higher level properties can be layered over it!">
						### Key Ideas
						- Full-distributed system
						- Reduce misbehavior to concurrency
						- Enforce Fork-Join-Causal consistency
							- _Dependency preservation_

						> Other storage properties left to be layered over FJC
					</section>
					<section data-markdown
					number = 17
data-notes="Identified the main ideas, the basic protocol is the logical consequence, it's a standard log exchange protocol that relies on 3 main elements to work:
The logical clock represents the 'age' of the update. It is incremented on every modification, and checked to decide if a data is fresh or not.
This works paired with a vector of dependencies. It includes the version of every file modified by the update, and it's used to identify concurrent modification and to reconstruct the paths I told you before. If I detect two updates on the system, and neither of them compare in the other's history, I have a concurrent update and I should then show it to the user, or leverage existing conflict-solving methods (as in git) to provide an accepted version to the final user.
Each update should then be signed, to provide the basic security features whe have seen in the other systems.">
						### Basic protocol
						Standard log exchange protocol
						- Logical clock
						- Dependency Version Vector
						- Signed updates
					</section>
					<section
					number = 18
data-notes="Takling the left-side requirements, Depot successfully provides availability, freshness and consistency constraint (even if we are talking of FJC consistency, that's enough). Signing the updates provides integrity and Authenticity, while confidentiality is left to be implemented by the higher level: it's not so difficult anyway.">
					<h3>Requirements</h3>
					<div style="display: inline-block">
						<div style="float:left; width: 50%" data-markdown>
							- Availability
							- Freshness
							- Consistency
						</div>
						<div style="float:left; width: 50%" data-markdown>
							- Confidentiality

						</div>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
				number = 19
data-notes="Performance wise, Depot has negligible cost managing small files. On bigger ones, GET cost is still small while put cost grows. This is still acceptable because storage system use is often asymmetric (many reads, few writes), and we are not talking about enormous slowdown factor as in SiRiUS.
This cost analysis is still partially incomplete though: in order to provide confidentiality features an overhead is required by the higher levels.">
					### Performance
					- GET cost
						- Comparable to checksumming data (2%)
					- PUT cost
						- Higher, but acceptable (56%)
