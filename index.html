				<section data-markdown
data-notes="After a short introduction where I will give an overview about purposes and challenges of this kind of systems, I will show you 3 different approaches to the problem. The first two approaches come from the secondary paper assigned to me, while the last is from the main text.">
					### Goal of the presentation
					Overview on untrusted storage systems
					- Purposes
					- Challenges
					- 3 different approaches

					General features of a remote file storage
				-->
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="First of all, why would someone want to use a cloud storage system?
Buying some space on some cloud means that you have no longer to worry about maintain physically some machines, some servers to store your data. In a full-cloud scenario, you don't have to worry about buying new servers, provide a continous supply of electricity, repair faults, make reundant backup copies of your data (just joking, you should still backup it. Maybe a little less, but ONLY A LITTLE).
This obviously come to a price: Cloud storage are black-boxes for you, you don't know what's going on under the hood because you have to trust your cloud service provider.">
					### Remote file storage
					- More flexible infrastructure
					- Less cost for mid and small business
					- Less know how required
					- ...But...

					> They are fault-prone black boxes operated by a party other than the data owner
				</section>
				<section
data-notes="There are a few fundamental requirements on which I would like you to focus in this presentation. Left ones are lower-level requirements, think them as the 'TCP/IP' of the storage systems. 
Data should be available, that means I should be able to read and write and use the system whenever I want.
Data should be fresh: not outdated or stale data.
Data should be consistent across the entire distributed system. There should be only one 'real' version of the data, even if replicated in several nodes of the cloud is unacceptable to have different conflicting files in each machine.
On the right instead we have higher level requirements, application level we could name them.
Data confidentiality regards who can read my data: if you are not authorized then you should not be able to read them.
No one shoud be able to tamper my data, so integrity is the second requirement.
In order to be sure that the user that wants to read or modify a file is who it claims to be, we need some authentication system.">

				<!-- 
					First Example: SiRiUS
				-->
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="As first example, I'll introduce SiRiUS. The aim of this project is to deliver a system easy for users to install and use. It should be installed over an existent system of cloud storage, in order to provide security and privacy features. As a consequence, referring to the past slide, it is focused on higher-level requirements.">
					### SiRiUS
					Securing Remote Untrusted Storage
					> "Easy for end-users to install and use."

					> "Can be **layered** on top of any network file system."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="SiRiUS relies on metadata, hidden from the user, to achieve his goal. Also, it heavily uses public and private keys for encription and authentication.
Each file is encrypted with a symmetric key (we call it 'file key'). This key is then encrypted using the public key of each user, and added to the metadata file. In that way, when an authorized user wants to read the file, it can retrieve the file key from the metadata and use it.
File signature public key is used to check the integrity of the file, last modified timestamp is checked is used to enforce freshness check over the file system, and filename is used to link each file with his metadata file.
Metadata file is then signed using the owner's signature: that means only the file owner can modify it.">
					![SiRiUS metadata structure](./img/sirius_meta_structure.png)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="This data structure successfully ensure the three security requirements desired, usign the properties of asymmetric keys. Only the authorized users can decrypt the file and read it (or modify it), file signature prevents undetected tampering of the file content, and I am sure that a user is who it claims to be because he is in possession of his specific private key.">

						- <img src="./img/my_icon_collection/svg/001-tick.svg" height="30px" style="vertical-align: middle"> Integrity

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="Takling the higher level, this system falls a bit short on lower level requirements: freshness is only guaranteed for the metadata, there is no timestamp on the file content. Availability too is not addressed in any way, just delegated to the system that host SiRiUS.">
					### Other requirements
					- Freshness
						- Guaranteed for metadata
					- ~~Availability~~
						- _Delegated to lower layers_
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="This directly exposes some issues: Denial-Of-Service attacks is possible, targeting the underlying system.
A seizing attack is also possible: it is an attack where a malicious user change the entire content of the file system (metadata included) to add his key everywhere. It is quite impossible to perform this kind of attack undetected, but still..!
We have rollback issues: a malicious user could simply continously replace a file with an older version of it. There are some workaround to prevent this, but the 'vanilla protocol' is vulnerable.
The final, enormous issue is the performance issue.">
					### Problems
					- Availability (DoS)
					- Seizing
					- Rollback
					- **Performance**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="These are the slowdown factors on read and write using SiRiUS. They are huge, and this mainly depends on Asymmetric key system. 63% of the read time is spent on AES decrypt, 40% of the write time on signature generation, these are very significative numbers!">
					<textarea data-template>
						| | Small files | Big files|
						|---|---|---|
						|Read|20x|2.3x|
						|Write|20x|6.3x|
						
						> 63% of the read time on AES decrypt. </br>
						> 40% of the write time on signature generation.

				<!-- 
					Second Example: CRUST
				-->
				<section data-markdown
				data-notes="This take us to our second example: CRUST.">
					### CRUST
					Cryptographic Remote Untrusted Storage

					without Public Keys
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Design
					- Needs a Trusted Agent
						- Shares a secret key with each user
						- Public database of _"key seeds"_
					- Meta-data structure of SiRiUS
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Better performance
						| | CRUST | SiRiUS |
						|---|---|---|
						|Read|1.03x|2.3x|
						|Write|1.28x|6.3x|

						> Still no availability guaranteed

					<!-- 
						Final Example: Depot
					-->
					<section data-markdown>
						### Depot
						Cloud storage with minimal trust
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Properties
						- Eliminates trust for safety
						- Minimizes trust for liveness and availability
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Key Ideas
						- Reduce misbehavior to concurrency
						- Enforce Fork-Join-Causal consistency
							- _Dependency preservation_

						> Other storage properties left to be layered over FJC
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Basic protocol
						Standard log exchange protocol
						- Logical clock
						- Dependency Version Vector
						- Signed updates
