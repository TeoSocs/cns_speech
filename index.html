					## Untrusted storage

				<section data-markdown
data-notes="After a short introduction where I will give an overview about purposes and challenges of this kind of systems, I will show you 3 different approaches to the problem. The first two approaches come from the secondary paper assigned to me, while the last is from the main text.">
					### Goal of the presentation
					Overview on untrusted storage systems
					- Purposes
					- Challenges
					- 3 different approaches
				</section>

				<!-- 
					General features of a remote file storage
				-->
				<section data-markdown
data-notes="First of all, why would someone want to use a cloud storage system?
Buying some space on some cloud means that you have no longer to worry about maintain physically some machines, some servers to store your data. In a full-cloud scenario, you don't have to worry about buying new servers, provide a continous supply of electricity, repair faults, make reundant backup copies of your data (just joking, you should still backup it. Maybe a little less, but ONLY A LITTLE).
This obviously come to a price: Cloud storage are black-boxes for you, you don't know what's going on under the hood because you have to trust your cloud service provider.">
					### Remote file storage
					- More flexible infrastructure
					- Less cost for mid and small business
					- Less know how required
					- ...But...

					> They are fault-prone black boxes operated by a party other than the data owner
				</section>
				<section
data-notes="There are a few fundamental requirements on which I would like you to focus in this presentation. Left ones are lower-level requirements, think them as the 'TCP/IP' of the storage systems. 
Data should be available, that means I should be able to read and write and use the system whenever I want.
Data should be fresh: not outdated or stale data.
Data should be consistent across the entire distributed system. There should be only one 'real' version of the data, even if replicated in several nodes of the cloud is unacceptable to have different conflicting files in each machine.
On the right instead we have higher level requirements, application level we could name them.
Data confidentiality regards who can read my data: if you are not authorized then you should not be able to read them.
No one shoud be able to tamper my data, so integrity is the second requirement.
In order to be sure that the user that wants to read or modify a file is who it claims to be, we need some authentication system, while non-repudiation is another desirable property which assure that if someone perform some action on a file he could not deny to have done it in the future.">

				<!-- 
					First Example: SiRiUS
				-->
				<section data-markdown>
					### SiRiUS
					Securing Remote Untrusted Storage
					> "Easy for end-users to install and use."

					> "Can be **layered** on top of any network file system."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown="">
					![SiRiUS metadata structure](./img/sirius_meta_structure.png)

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Security requirements
						- <img src="./img/my_icon_collection/svg/001-tick.svg" height="30px" style="vertical-align: middle"> Confidentiality 
						- <img src="./img/my_icon_collection/svg/001-tick.svg" height="30px" style="vertical-align: middle"> Integrity
						- <img src="./img/my_icon_collection/svg/001-tick.svg" height="30px" style="vertical-align: middle"> Autenticity

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Other requirements
					- Freshness
					- Guaranteed for metadata
					- ~~Availability~~
						- _Delegated to lower layers_
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Problems
					- Availability (DoS)
					- Seizing
					- Rollback
					- **Performance**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						| | Small files | Big files|
						|---|---|---|
						|Read|20x|2.3x|
						|Write|20x|6.3x|
						
						> 63% of the read time on AES decrypt. </br>
						> 40% of the write time on signature generation.
					</textarea>

				<!-- 
					Second Example: CRUST
				-->
				<section data-markdown>
					### CRUST
					Cryptographic Remote Untrusted Storage

					without Public Keys
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Design
					- Needs a Trusted Agent
						- Shares a secret key with each user
						- Public database of _"key seeds"_
					- Meta-data structure of SiRiUS
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Better performance
						| | CRUST | SiRiUS |
						|---|---|---|
						|Read|1.03x|2.3x|
						|Write|1.28x|6.3x|

						> Still no availability guaranteed
					</textarea>

					<!-- 
						Final Example: Depot
					-->
					<section data-markdown>
						### Depot
						Cloud storage with minimal trust
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Properties
						- Eliminates trust for safety
						- Minimizes trust for liveness and availability
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Key Ideas
						- Reduce misbehavior to concurrency
						- Enforce Fork-Join-Causal consistency
							- _Dependency preservation_

						> Other storage properties left to be layered over FJC
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Basic protocol
						Standard log exchange protocol
						- Logical clock
						- Dependency Version Vector
						- Signed updates
